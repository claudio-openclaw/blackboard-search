# Blackboard UI — Quick heuristics

Load this only when you need help unblocking navigation/labels.

## Common section names
- Courses: **Courses**, **My Courses**, **Course List**
- Content: **Course Content**, **Content**, **Materials**, **Learning Materials**
- Announcements: **Announcements**
- Assignments: **Assignments**, **Assessments**
- Grades: **Grades**, **My Grades**, **Gradebook**
- Messages: **Messages**, **Course Messages**
- Files: **Files**, **Content Collection**
- Info: **Syllabus**, **Course Information**, **Instructor Information**

## Patterns to find search
- Top bar input “Search”
- Magnifying glass / search icon
- Filters by type (Document, File, Assignment)
- Sort by “Newest/Oldest”

## Strategy when there is no search
1) Open “Course Content”
2) Expand modules/weeks
3) Use Cmd/Ctrl+F on the current page
4) Check “Files/Content Collection” to search by name (PDF/DOCX/PPT)

## What to ask the user (low-friction)
- Approximate exact file name (“Syllabus”, “Week 2 slides”, “Project 1”) or 2–3 keywords.
- Likely course (if multiple, ask for a shortlist).
- If searching by date: an approximate range.

## Security / credentials
- Don’t ask for passwords.
- If it’s SSO, ask the user to sign in manually in the browser.
